# About me
Hey! My name's Colin Robertson. At the time of writing, I'm a senior in high
school. I hail from New Jersey (if you're ever thinking of visiting New Jersey:
don't) and plan on attending college at Rutgers.

## Who I am (outside of code)
I have quite a few passions. I've always enjoyed playing video-games (my
personal favorites include _osu!_, _Counter-Strike: Global Offensive_, and, of
course, _Minecraft_) and spend a fair amount of my free time doing exactly that.
When I'm not on my computer, either writing code or playing games, I enjoy
playing drums, reading, and writing.

## Who I am (not outside of code)
I already know this is the part you're probably interested in.

### My programming journey
My programming journey began at the ripe age of 7, when my father introduced me
to the world of computers and electronics by building an RC car with me. At that
point, I was barely able to read simple Python code, so I relied on my dad for
assistance with much of that project. I continued by building a couple other
small projects - a useless box and a line-following robot are the two examples
that come to mind.

In 7th grade, I co-founded a robotics team at my middle school. Thus, FTC team
11253 "Rumblebots" (formerly known as "Roxbotix Jr") came to be. That's where
my passion for programming really began to bloom. Although my code was
objectively pretty horrible, it... worked, I guess. Tasked with programming a
robot that could be controlled by a user (as well as complete a set of tasks in
an autonomous period), we utilized Java. As a result, Java is the first
programming language I feel confident saying I feel truly comfortable with.
I've been a member of Rumblebots for 6 years now, and it's been quite the
journey.

As I entered high school, I developed a Discord-like chat application to use
with my friends in school. I utilized plain JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, as well
as Firebase, to create it. In retrospect, it was truly an awful demonstration of
programming abilities, but it was the first major project I did for my own
enjoyment. The chat service came to an unfortunate conclusion when it was
blocked by the school for distracting my peers during class, but the fire had
already been lit, and I began to take programming more seriously.
