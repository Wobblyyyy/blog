# About me
Hey! My name's Colin Robertson. At the time of writing, I'm a senior in high
school. I hail from New Jersey (if you're ever thinking of visiting New Jersey:
don't) and plan on attending college at Rutgers.

## Who I am (outside of code)
I have quite a few passions. I've always enjoyed playing video-games (my
personal favorites include _osu!_, _Counter-Strike: Global Offensive_, and, of
course, _Minecraft_) and spend a fair amount of my free time doing exactly that.
When I'm not on my computer, either writing code or playing games, I enjoy
playing drums, reading, and writing.

## Who I am (not outside of code)
I already know this is the part you're probably interested in.

### My programming journey
My programming journey began at the ripe age of 7, when my father introduced me
to the world of computers and electronics by building an RC car with me. At that
point, I was barely able to read simple Python code, so I relied on my dad for
assistance with much of that project. I continued by building a couple other
small projects - a useless box and a line-following robot are the two examples
that come to mind.

In 7th grade, I co-founded a robotics team at my middle school. Thus, FTC team
11253 "Rumblebots" (formerly known as "Roxbotix Jr") came to be. That's where
my passion for programming really began to bloom. Although my code was
objectively pretty horrible, it... worked, I guess. Tasked with programming a
robot that could be controlled by a user (as well as complete a set of tasks in
an autonomous period), we utilized Java. As a result, Java is the first
programming language I feel confident saying I feel truly comfortable with.
I've been a member of Rumblebots for 6 years now, and it's been quite the
journey.

As I entered high school, I developed a Discord-like chat application to use
with my friends in school. I utilized plain JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, as well
as Firebase, to create it. In retrospect, it was truly an awful demonstration of
programming abilities, but it was the first major project I did for my own
enjoyment. The chat service came to an unfortunate conclusion when it was
blocked by the school for distracting my peers during class, but the fire had
already been lit, and I began to take programming more seriously.

Between my junior and senior years of high school, I was presented with the
opportunity to be an IT Intern for KPM Exceptional. Unfortunately, this
arrangement concluded after a couple of months due to some scheduling conflicts,
but working on an office environment both taught me a lot and sharpened my
programming skills. I worked primarily in C#: having a background in Java made
it easy to pick up C#.

### My favorite tech
Like any other developer, I have a lot of preferences when it comes to the
tools I use to write code.

#### Vim (and, by extension, Neovim)
[Vim][vim] is described as "a free and open-source, screen-based text editor,"
and that's exactly what it is. I decided to learn Vim during quarantine,
largely out of boredom. To put it simply, learning Vim is extremely difficult
and requires a lot of dedication. It took me several months to finally start to
feel comfortable using Vim for every-day editing. At the time of writing, I've
been using Vim as my primary IDE for several months, and it's absolutely insane
how much it's boosted my productivity. There's a keyboard shortcut for
absolutely everything, and absolutely everything can be customized, with very
few limitations on what you can and can't do.

#### Java
Java was the first programming language I fell in love with, and it's still the
language I feel the most comfortable working with. It's object-oriented nature
made it relatively easy for me to pick up, and many of the concepts I learned
while working with Java transfer over to other programming languages extremely
well. I find that Java is a happy medium between being high-level enough to
grasp relatively quickly while also being low-level enough to teach concepts
such as data structures, which I find languages like Python and JavaScript
gloss over.
